        <p class="intro">
        The meaning of art is often culturally specific, shared among the members of a given society and dependent upon cultural context. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate political, spiritual or philosophThe nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture." It has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.

        <h2 id="subhead2">How did i get interested in it?</h2>
        <p class="intro">
        Since I was a kid I had some type of attraction towards art and design. Both my parents are interested in art. During my weekends I would often spend my time in art galleries taking my time to learn and appreciate the work of all great artists. After experimenting different techniques, I soon realised that i was more interested in abstract art and am now working on developing my skills on it.
