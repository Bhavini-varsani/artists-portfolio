        <h2 id="subheading">Who inspired me?</h2>
        <p id="info1">As I started getting more fascinated with art, there are obviously certain artists whom kept me motivated to keep developing my skills and experimenting with new techniques. Some of them are listed below along side a brief description about them.</p>
            <h3 class="artists leo">Leonardo Da Vinci</h3>
                <p class="info2 leo">Born on April 15, 1452, in Vinci, Italy, Leonardo da Vinci was the epitome of a “Renaissance man.” Possessor of a curious mind and keen intellect, da Vinci studied the laws of science and nature, which greatly informed his work as a painter, sculptor, architect, inventor, military engineer and draftsman. His ideas and body of work—which includes "Virgin of the Rocks," "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa"—have influenced countless artists and made da Vinci a leading light of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
            <h3 class="artists jasper">Jasper Johns</h3>
                <p class="info2 jasper">Jasper Johns was born in Georgia in 1930 and grew up in South Carolina. After moving to New York City to pursue a career as an artist, he found fame in the 1950s for his paintings of flags, targets and other ordinary objects; this work was a change from Abstract Expression and helped usher in the Pop Art era. Over the course of his career, he has collaborated with an array of other artists, including choreographer Merce Cunningham. Johns, who also works in sculpture and printmaking, remains a leader in the art world.</p>
            <h3 class="artists ells">Ellsworth Kelly</h3>
                <p class="info2 ells">The G.I. bill enabled Ellsworth Kelly to travel to Paris in 1948 and explore the avant-garde art movement. By the end of the 1950s, Kelly had become a leading exponent of the hard-edge style of painting, in which abstract contours and large areas of flat color are sharply defined. He refined his style throughout the late 20th century, branching into printmaking and large-scale public sculpture.</p>
